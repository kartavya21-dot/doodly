🎮 Real-Time Drawing & Guessing Game – Flow Documentation
📌 Overview

This document describes the event-driven flow of the real-time multiplayer drawing and guessing game.

The system follows a WebSocket-based architecture, where:

Clients (frontend) send events
Server processes game logic
Server broadcasts updates to all connected players
⚙️ Game Events (Types)

The game operates using the following event types:

Event Type	Description
JOIN	A user joins the game
START	Admin starts the game
CHOOSE_WORD	Current player selects a word
DRAW	Current player sends drawing data
GUESS	Players send guesses
WIN	A correct guess is made
NEXT_ROUND	Start of next round
GAME_END	Game finishes after all rounds

🧠 Notes & Assumptions
Server is the single source of truth for:
current_player
current_word
round state
Player order is maintained using a queue system
All communication is handled via WebSockets
🚧 Future Improvements
Persist game state (e.g., queue, rounds) using DB or cache
Add explicit game states (WAITING, CHOOSING, DRAWING, ENDED)
Improve validation (prevent cheating from client-side input)
Add timers for rounds and turns
Handle reconnections gracefully
